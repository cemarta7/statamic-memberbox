# Introduction

This Statamic addon provides an out of the box solution for adding a members area or member restricted content to your site, building on Statamic’s existing user management and user form tags. It also provides a dedicated members section in the control panel, allowing you to manage members independently of other users.

## Who’s a Member?

This addon defines a member as any user who has the roles and groups listed in the `statamic.users.new_user_roles` and `statamic.users.new_user_groups` config variables, as these are the roles and groups Statamic assigns to users who register themselves through the user registration form.
